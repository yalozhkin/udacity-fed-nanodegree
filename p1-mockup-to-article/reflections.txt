You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I have learned about the structure of an article. I was familiar with the basics before but figured out many new details. It was refreshing!
* That was easy to handle basic things like links, paragraphs, headings.
* I had some doubts about using the style attribute in tags and the requirement to get a page exactly as a screenshot provided. The actual GIF asset was smaller comparing to the screenshot's version (actually,  it was blurry of the screenshot).
* I coded step by step, from the easiest things to more complex ones. It gave me self-confidence and control on the project.
